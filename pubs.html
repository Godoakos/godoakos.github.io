      <b>Abstract (Excerpt):</b>
      <p>
        In this paper, I have described the method of fundus photography used for diagnosis and the potential problems
        arising from its use. Using Python and MATLAB scripts and a freely available dataset, I have created a learning
        and test set for a machine learning method, the steps of which I have summarized.
      </p>
      <p>
        I attempted to improve the quality of the samples using an image processing method.
        I have reviewed the operation of some methods that have achieved significant results in medical image processing,
        such as the naive Bayesian classifier, the (k-)NN algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM) and neural networks. 
        I have also described in detail the working principle of my chosen method, neural networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I solved a five-class classification problem using deep convolutional neural networks. 
        I presented the theoretical and empirical background of network design.

      <b>Abstract (Excerpt):</b>
      <p>
        A highly relevant task in Computer Aided Drug Design during the research of drug
        candidate molecules is the study of the bonding affinity between proteins and various
        small molecules which exhibit biological or pharmacological activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This task requires a large amount of computational resources because even for a single protein a high quantity
        of binding sites and feasible ligand molecules exist. Thus, it is customary to support the
        high-precision simulations by less resource intensive calculations beforehand to filter out
        less promising candidates. A possible angle of approach to this early approximation is
        the use of machine learning methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be able to determine if a protein-ligand binding reaction would take place the re-
        action energy must be obtained. I presented various methods currently in use both in
        the industry and academic research which are used to obtain these energies: the basics
        of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and wave function based methods while diving
        into further detail with the Molecular Mechanics based approach

      <b>Abstract (Excerpt):</b>
      <p>
        Can state-of-the-art computer vision methods be applied for protein structure
        determination tasks? This thesis answers the above question by defining
        the problem of locating and classifying amino acid (AA) residues in protein
        electron density (ED) maps as an image segmentation problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        A custom data set with annotations for supervised semantic and instance
        segmentation is created to train and evaluate network performance. It contains 
        high-, mid- and low-resolution ED maps generated from the same ap-
        proximately 7000 proteins, allowing the CNNs to specifically target each
        resolution. With low-resolution data in the challenging sub-3 Å range, the
        CNNs can be trained to be functional even where state-of-the-art toolkits fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed methods assign AA labels directly to ED maps by crop-stitching fixed size
        windows, only observing the densities without relying on the AA sequence.
        The first proposed CNN architecture, 3D FC-DenseNet matches the performance 
        of state-of-the-art toolkits at high resolutions, and beats them at
        medium and especially at low resolutions, which are a failure case for toolkits. 
        Its upgrade, MT-StackNet is capable of simultaneous semantic and instance segmentation
        of ED maps and, due its improved performance, it outperforms model building toolkits
        even at high resolutions. It can locate and classify all AA instances with a single
        forward pass using a novel offset vector regression technique.

        Both methods process ED maps with better performance and much faster
        than model building toolkits, showing that computer vision methods and
        CNNs are applicable for protein structure determination tasks.

      <b>Abstract:</b>
      <p>
        Despite constant advances in X-ray crystallography, the resolution of the acquired electron density maps 
        still poses a serious limit on protein protein structural model building efforts. Furthermore, the currently 
        available toolkits require hours or even days for model building. Methods capable of processing a large volume
        of samples in a short time which can also handle low resolution samples are needed. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This work proposes a neural network-based approach to locate and classify residues in crystallographic electron
        density maps automatically in a single forward pass without relying on the protein’s residue sequence. 
        Our proposed method shows an average 23.53% increase in accuracy over our previous approach and also compares
        favorably to currently available toolkits. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It can process protein samples in seconds on consumer-grade hardware saving significant time and resources.

      <b>Abstract:</b>
      <p>
        This work proposes a neural network architecture, called 3D FC-DenseNet, 
        for assigning amino acid labels to X-ray crystallographic electron density maps 
        without relying on the amino acid sequence of proteins.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The 3DFC-DenseNet is able to treat the task as a 3D semantic segmentation problem, 
        assigning amino acid labels directly to protein electron density maps. 

        By creating dedicated data sets and models for high, medium and low resolution samples, 
        our method matches the performance of crystallographic toolkits for primary structure assignment at high resolutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, it outperforms them at medium resolution and functions at low resolutions where current toolkits and human ability fails.

      <b>Abstract:</b>
      <p>
        We present a 3D convolutional neural network architecture for locating and classifying residues in volumetric electron density
        (ED) maps in a single forward pass without relying on the protein’s residue sequence. Although originally trained on ED maps
        acquired via x-ray diffraction (XRD), due in part to the problem setting’s generality, we show that our method is also
        applicable to potential maps acquired via cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM). It functions even with low (sub-3.5Å) resolution
        samples and can process entire proteins in seconds to minutes on readily available consumer-grade hardware.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Our custom data set consists of generated ED as well as potential maps of approximately 7000 proteins closely following the
        features of real-life samples at high, medium, and low resolutions. By having maps of the same proteins across multiple
        resolutions and imaging methods, direct comparison of performance is possible. Furthermore, it contains over 1000 real-life,
        experimentally acquired maps in the 1.5 to 4Å resolution range to measure actual performance. This, to our knowledge, makes it
        the largest and most comprehensive dataset for structure segmentation in maps acquired via XRD or Cryo-EM.
